# About
This is a tool that can be used to get movie suggestions when you can't decide on what to use. It's still a bit rough and needs some polishing (especially on the design side) but as it was made as a side project for fun it can be understandable that some things may not be very polished.

Now that that got out of the way, let's get into some of the nerdy stuff.


The project is completely free and open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://gitub.com/Endi1/suggestmovie). Feel free to fork it and contribute if you feel like it.

To find movie information I am using [The Movie Database](http://themoviedb.org) API which is pretty cool. 

It's built on React and I am using Material-UI for react for the components. Since Material-UI gives me all the UI components I need, I have used Skeleton for its  grid system. 

If you want to know more in debth on how everything works, head over to [How it works](http://localhost/#how).
